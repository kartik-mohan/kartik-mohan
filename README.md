<h2 align="center">Hi there!👋<br> I am Kartik Mohan:man_technologist:</h2>

<p>I'm a graduate student pursuing MS in Data Science at Northeastern University on the journey to become a Data Scientist.
 
Jumping straight into the dataset and exploring various visualizations 📊 and correlations 📈 in search of patterns often takes me back to my childhood memory of digging through a pile of Legos 🧱. 

Data Science has not only satiated my penchant for exploration but also served the acute analytic skill. My interest in this field has only ameliorated over the years, and it urged me to pursue advanced studies 🎓 in this field.

Data Science is evolving rapidly because of the increasing demand of data around the world 🌎. It very well may be the pivot point on which the entire economy 💲 turns.

I wish to help business houses 🏢 to recognize their presence in the markets and making apt decisions 📝.

I am happy to network and collaborate 🤝.

Have a great day 😃.
